### 📋 Brand System Brief: Zyvi

**1. Brand Identity**
* **Name:** Zyvi
* **Pronunciation:** *"Zee-Vee"* (Rhymes with "CV" or "TV").
* **Tagline:** Tailor your CV to pass the filter.
* **Category:** HR Tech / Career SaaS.

**2. Strategic Rationale**
* **The Name:** A phonetic play on "CV." The 'Z' signals speed, energy, and distinctiveness. The unique spelling (**Zyvi** vs. Zivi) is intentional to avoid association with the German term "Zivildienst" (Civil Service) and to distinguish from existing competitors.
* **The Tagline:** Since the name is abstract, the tagline is purely functional. It addresses the user's primary anxiety (the ATS filter) and promises a specific action (Tailoring).

**3. Product Context**
* **The Problem:** Good candidates get rejected by Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) because their CVs lack specific keywords or formatting.
* **The Solution:** An automated tool that parses a user’s CV and a specific Job Description, then instantly rewrites/formats the CV to match that specific job.
* **Business Model:** Freemium. The first tailored CV is free; subsequent uses require a subscription.

**4. Brand Voice & Tone**
* **Primary Tone:** Precise, Algorithmic, Fast, Trustworthy.
* **Secondary Tone:** Empowering (but not "cheerleader-y").
* **Keywords to Use:** Parse, Align, Optimize, Match, Score, Precision.
* **Keywords to Avoid:** "Coach" (implies human service), "Magic" (too vague), "Civil" (avoid confusion).

**5. Visual & Formatting Guidelines**
* **Aesthetic:** Clean SaaS, high-contrast, modern tech.
* **Logo Concept:** Symmetrical (`Z-y-v-i`). The logo should hint at the "CV" connection, potentially highlighting the "V" or using checkmark motifs.
* **Spelling:** Always capitalize **Zyvi**. Never "zyvi" (unless in a URL) or "Zivy."
